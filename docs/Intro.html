            <p>
                Turing Lab is a service that enables interaction with the Ollama model without requiring third-party
                dependencies
                such as Docker or Python runtimes. This service can operate on both local and remote servers and can be
                accessed
                through a web-based interface or desktop application.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to providing an intuitive interface, the server offers a wide range of features, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Model debugging (e.g., token count, model parameters)</li>
                <li>Automated system analysis for optimal model selection</li>
                <li>Concurrent message request handling</li>
                <li>Stateful and stateless APIs for message processing</li>
                <li>Pipelines for image, voice, and video input/output</li>
                <li>AI agent creation and management</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Additional features include integration of non-LLM models with LLMs to enhance comprehension
                and usability for non-technical users.
            </p>

            <p>
                These capabilities open new opportunities for innovation in AI agents by incorporating ML models as
                agent inputs,
                fostering more advanced and versatile AI solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                And much more...
